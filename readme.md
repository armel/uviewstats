# Description

uViewStats is a system monitor: CPU, Memory, Disk and Network. It uses the MicroView to display information in real time.

# Quickstart

## Prerequisites
First, you need to install [**Python**] (https://www.python.org), if you haven't done so already. 

Second, install **pip**, a tool for installing and managing Python packages. It works on Unix/Linux, OS X, and Windows. To install or upgrade pip, securely download [get-pip.py] (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). Then run the following (which may require administrator access, so you can use sudo):

~~~
$ sudo python get-pip.py
~~~

Third, install 2 Python packages: **psutil** and **pyserial**. For this, run the following:

~~~
$ sudo pip install psutil
$ sudo pip install pyserial
~~~

## Installation

First, start Arduino IDE, open `uviewstats.ino`, compile and upload it.

Second, start your favorite editor (personnaly, I'm using [SublimeText] (http://www.sublimetext.com/)), open `uviewstats.py` and set the `PORT` constant.

Third, open a `Terminal` and start the Python script:

~~~
$ python uviewstats.py
~~~

Thatâ€™s all !
